        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure to have a <strong>cooked rice prepped hours before</strong>. We do not want a fresh one because we want to avoid the moisture that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Prep the pan and set the fire to small/medium to avoid burning on the onions</li>
            <li>Chop the onions into small pieces and put it in the pan along with the cooking oil. Make sure to stir it at interval to avoid burning on the onions</li>
            <li>Put the stock cube of your choice into the pan. Stir until it melts</li>
            <li>Put the meat of your choice into the pan. This may take some time depending on the size of the meat</li>
            <li>Once you are confident that the meat are cooked, put the cooked rice into the pan and make sure to stir it to ensure that cooking oil is evenly spread on the rice</li>
            <li>Optional: You can prepare omelette egg beforehand and add it along with the cooked rice in the frying pan</li>
            <li>Once you are confident that it is evenly spread, you can now take it out and serve it.</li>
